# TODO: delete full loader (no purpose),
    #   better documentation on all scripts
    #   write down all processes before continuing further,
    #   maybe create custom collate functions for dataloader, in order to receive variable sizes for images and masks?
    #   include sequence frames?
    #   implement resnetunet
    #   check how many masks are in each category (class balance)
    #   create visualizations for raw data (there is no point for visualization in train data, i think)
