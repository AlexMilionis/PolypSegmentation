### Project Title: 
Comparative Study of State-of-the-Art Deep Learning Techniques for Polyp Segmentation

### Description  
This repository contains the code and resources for my thesis project, which aims to perform a comparative study of state-of-the-art deep learning models for polyp segmentation in medical imaging. The project evaluates and compares multiple advanced architectures, to determine their effectiveness, accuracy, and computational efficiency in segmenting polyps in endoscopic images. The goal is to provide insights into the best practices and model architectures for this crucial medical task.

### Objectives  
- Comprehensive Model Evaluation: Compare multiple SOTA deep learning models for polyp segmentation.
- Dataset Handling: Efficient preprocessing and augmentation of medical imaging datasets for robust training and evaluation.
- Performance Metrics: Assess model performance using metrics such as Dice Coefficient, Jaccard Index (IoU), precision, and recall.
- Visualization: Provide clear and interpretable visualizations of model predictions compared to ground truth.

### Features
- Dataset Preprocessing: Automated scripts for preparing and aligning images and masks, with optional inclusion of sequence data.
- Multiple Model Architectures: Implementation of various models to compare their performance.
- Training Pipeline: Modularized training loop supporting mixed precision for efficiency.
- Evaluation and Visualization: Tools for detailed evaluation and visualization of predictions for better interpretability.
- Reproducibility: Controlled randomness through seeding for consistent experimental results.
